# Minecraft Datapacks
A collection of various Minecraft datapacks I created for personal use on the multiplayer servers that I host.\
This mainly address some aspects that are not covered by the excellent [Vanilla Tweaks](https://vanillatweaks.net/picker/datapacks/) datapacks.

## Usage
These datapacks will work with Minecraft versions 1.20 - 1.20.1. They have been tested to work in both singeplayer and multiplayer. Download the folder of the datapack(s) you wish to use and follow the installation instructions below.

## Installation
1. Ensure that the datapacks you have downloaded are not zipped. If they are, unzip them. You should have folders with the names of the datapacks with those folders containing a `pack.mcmeta` file and a `data` folder.
1. With your chosen datapack(s) downloaded, open the Minecraft world folder you wish to add the datapack(s) to.
2. Open the `datapacks` folder.
3. Move the datapack(s) folders into the `datapacks` folder.
4. If the Minecraft world is already open, type `/reload` in the chat. Otherwise, open the world and the datapack(s) will be installed.

## Datapacks
### Unpackable Quartz
This datapack allows quartz blocks to be crafted back into 4 quartz (the item). This is useful for when you only have quartz blocks on hand and want to convert them back into quartz for crafting.
